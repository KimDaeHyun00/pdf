2.2.1 Protective Equipment

When working with ESS, the following personal protective equipment must be worn:

High voltage rated rubber gloves -Safety goggles or other eye protection.
2.2.2 Organic Solvent Electrolyte

WARNING: Cell components of ESS contain organic solvent-based

electrolyte. Breach of individual cells may allow some electrolyte to be

released from the cell. Direct contact with the liquid electrolyte can cause

skin irritation. If contact with the liquid electrolyte occurs, follow the

suggestions below to minimize the chance of injury:

Flush eyes immediately with cold running water for at least 15 minutes.
Rinse skin immediately with water for at least 15 minutes.
Remove clothing if soiled.
Seek immediate medical attention.
2.2.3 Electrolyte Vent Product

WARNING: The Lithium-Ion chemistry used in ESS contains an organic

solvent-based electrolyte. If ESS is misused, damaged or abused, internal

cell pressure may increase to excessive levels. Each cell within the ESS is

equipped with a non-resettable vent so that if internal cell pressure

increases, the cell’s vent will activate releasing the electrolyte vent

products. When operated as intended and designed, internal cell pressure

remains stable and no electrolyte product venting occurs.

Organic solvent electrolyte vent products are flammable. To avoid serious injury from the

release and ignition of flammable products, the following guidelines must be observed:

Operate the ESS under conditions only as specified in this manual.
Keep sparks, flames and smoking materials away from the ESS.
Do not incinerate, puncture or impact the ESS.
Do not solder or weld to the ESS.

2.2.4 High Voltage Sources

DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE – ELECTRIC SHOCK HAZARD. ESS does not

include the enclosure. As all Battery Modules and wires are exposed, the

probability of electric shock is high. ESS contains high voltage electric shock

sources. Do NOT open any cover of Battery Module and Tray Assembly.

Exposure to high voltage can cause serious electrical burns, shock or death. To avoid

high voltage electrical shock, follow the guidelines below:

Do not work with high voltages unless you are qualified personnel.
Personnel must fully understand the safety precautions associated with working
on high voltage circuits.

Personnel must fully understand the risk of working with batteries, and be
prepared and equipped to take the necessary safety precautions.

Necessary equipment, including but not limited to insulated tools, high voltage
rated rubber gloves, rubber aprons, safety goggles, and face protection must be

used.

Ensure that the system is powered off and disconnected from outside circuits
before servicing the unit.

2.3 Unloading and Unpacking

Carefully remove the plastic cover from the pallet. The packages are situated on a

pallet on which it can be transported via forklift from location to location. A damaged

box or rattles during transport may indicate rough handling. Make a descriptive

notation on the delivery receipt before signing. If damage is found, request an

inspection by the carrier and file a damage claim. Pay particular attention to a

damaged crate or staining from electrolyte or other fluids. Delay in notifying carrier

may result in the loss of reimbursement for damages.

8 .1 Service

There are no user serviceable parts in the Tray Assembly. Written authorization from

BUMHAN UNISOL is required to open the Tray Assembly or perform any maintenance

thereon. For service inquiries and questions, please contact BUMHAN UNISOLUTION.

8 .2 Maintenance

8.2.1 Be sure to refer to the specialist construction personnel for installation movement

and installation work.

Failure to install the installation criteria may result in safety accidents. We request that
you entreat us.

8.2.2 Caution for selecting battery power wire size

Connect the battery power line (for charging or discharging) to match the + / -polarity.
Use the output line according to the allowable current value. The wire goes up and down,

causing a fire. (High current causes overheating and fire.)

It is not appropriate to determine the size of the wire relative to the front of the wire

thickness, which is normally used to determine the wire size between the battery and the

final load. A voltage drop is caused by flowing current or when the length of the wire is

long enough to cause a voltage drop.

With this voltage drop, the voltage applied to the wire is low enough to supply the load to

the wire attached to the wire.

In particular, when a peak current is required for a high peak, the voltage drop becomes

smaller and the voltage drop becomes larger. Therefore, use a large enough wire.

8.2.3 Cautions for charging when applying to ESS and UPS systems

Do not operate the charging mode on the charger.
This product does not require a uniform charging operation, unlike lead acid batteries,

and should not apply uniformly charging mode.

Do not operate the equivalent charging mode when setting up the operating unit

(charger) operation.

8.2.4 Safety and protection functions (common specification)

Over-current protection (charge current and discharge current limit)
By the Protection Circuit (BMS) of this battery, the I/O current is limited to the set value

(refer to model specification).

This function prevents the battery from being subjected to excessive current, thereby

ensuring the battery is safe.

Short circuit to short circuit (Short) : Short circuit to short circuit between short and short

circuits (short) when handling short circuits (short), the protection circuit (BMS) immediately

shuts off the output.

Over Voltage Protection
The voltage of the lithium ion cell cellis monitored by the BMS (battery) protected by the

battery.

When charging, each cell group stops charging when the specified voltage exceeds the

specified voltage value, and restores resume when the specified voltage is restored.

Under Voltage Protection
The lithium ion cell voltage is monitored by the BMS (battery) protected by this battery.

If each cell group falls below the prescribed voltage limit, the discharged discharge will

resume once the recovery is resumed and the discharged voltage will resume.

Temperature control unit
The protection circuitry (BMS) shuts down the output immediately when temperature

sensing is detected.

8.2.5 General Precautions for Use

As the temperature increases, it is necessary to shorten the battery life and ensure that it is
well ventilated.

Use a current rated current and a rated drain current before the battery charge is charged.
Avoid direct moisture contact.
Do not use any other forms of utilization and wiring other than the user production
described in the manual.

Do not put fire into fire, heat, or fire.
Do not attempt to disassemble and damage the disassembly and exit.
8.2.6 Maintenance check cycle

SMPS function check cycle -3 ~ 5 years (replace if necessary)
Battery capacity function check cycle -3 years
Other electronic parts such as fuse, relay, module –3years (replace if necessary)
8.2.7 Decomposition or modification are prohibited.

It may cause unexpected accidents.
